    "text": "Other datasets\nAbove we explored “late-succession” habitat, which might be considered to be the ‘top of the funnel’ or widest possible way to look at later stages of ecosystem development. Below we explore some other related datasets currently available.\n\nMature and Old Growth Data from the US Forest Service (USFS)\nTo support “Executive Order 14072 (also known as “Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies”)“, USFS scientists have defined and mapped ‘mature’ and ‘old-growth’ forests on USFS and Bureau of Land Management lands of the US. Their definitions are largely based on relatively reliably mapped characteristics of tree diameter and trees per acre.\nAt time of this assessment, raw data was not available for further assessment to our knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the USFS Mature and Old-Growth Forest Map.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Central Upper Peninsula area, a few things stand out from their map:\n\nThere are no ‘High Old-Growth’ areas.\nHigh ‘Mature/Low Old-Growth’ areas are mapped in the eastern portion of the assessment area, largely in line with Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, and the western area of the Hiawatha National Forest.\n\nWe strongly recommend reading the full report, available here, and exploring the data viewer.\n\n\nMature and Old-Growth mapping effort by Barnett et al. (2023)\nIn a recently published paper, Barnett et al. (2023) classified, inventoried and mapped mature and old-growth (MOG) forests for the US. Whereas many MOG mapping attempts use some combination of tree height and/or age and/or density, the authors assessed carbon accumulation, and assumed (briefly) that old-growth occurred:\n\n“…at the age when the density of total forest carbon stored in live and dead biomass reaches 95% of the empirically derived maximum, and the mature forest stage as occurring between the peak average carbon increment and the age of onset of old growth.”\n\nAt time of this assessment, raw data was not available for further assessment to our knowledge. However from Figure 8 in the paper a few patterns jump out:\n\nMost of the Upper Peninsula is mapped as ‘young’ or ‘mature’.\n\nThere appear to be scattered pixels (small areas) with ‘Old-Growth’ scattered around the area, with no discernible concentrations of old-growth.\n\n\n\nMature and Old-Growth Contributions project by DellaSala et al. (2022)\nAuthors of this paper used combinations of forest canopy height, cover and above-ground living biomass to map mature and old-growth forests (among many other things). To summarize, the authors held workshops with scientists to develop ‘rulesets’ or thresholds of the three aforementioned parameters for each of 28 forest types groups, then combined the necessary datasets to map mature and old-growth forests.\nThe authors do share their datasets at https://www.matureforests.org/data. Here’s a quick map of ‘mature’ forest pixels for the analysis area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of mature areas as mapped by Della-Sala et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map most closely aligns with ours, identifying a substantial amount of the analysis area as ‘mature’."

    "text": "Notes on LANDFIRE data\nIn LANDFIRE, late-succession was not specifically designed for old-growth/mature forest identification. We use LANDFIRE data here because:\n\nThere are robust descriptions and ecological models for each ecosystem that have been peer reviewed. Learn more about the process from Blankenship et al., (2021), and Swaty et al., (2021).\nThe datasets and models cover all lands, not just agency lands for example.\nLate succession as defined in the LANDFIRE models and descriptions is ‘highly-inclusive’, and can serve to highlight areas for more detailed field examinations.\nLANDFIRE’s view of ecosystems includes natural disturbances (including Indigenous burning, wildfires, windthrow, etc.), which is in line with current ecological theory. This is particularly important in disturbance-driven ecosystems such as the Northern Pine(-Oak) Forests which would have had frequent surface fires prior to European Settlement. These fires resulted in a fair amount of ’Late-Open” successional habitat."

Our map illustrates “Wildfire Exposure Risk,” showing the likelihood of fire spread.
